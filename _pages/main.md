Our mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to create more! We aim to develop artificial intelligence and deep learning technologies to create a variety of content, such as text, speech, sound, music, digital human creation, etc. 

Our efforts include developing fundamental methodologies for content creation and designing dedicated models for each creation task: 
* ***Fundamental Methologies for Content Creation***
  + [**Regeneration Learning**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08846), a learning paradigm for data generation, as a counterpart of representation learning for data understanding. 
  + [**Transformer Architecture**](https://ai-creation.github.io/methodology/#method_architecture), which enhance Transformer with advanced architecture designs or memory/retrieval to ease data generation.
  + [**Diffusion Models**](https://ai-creation.github.io/methodology/#method_diffusion), focusing on inference speedup and applying to discrete data generation.
* ***Speech Generation***
  + [**FastSpeech**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09263) & [**FastSpeech 2**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558): Widely adopted text-to-speech synthesis models.
  + [**NaturalSpeech**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04421): Human-level quality on text-to-speech synthesis.
  + [**NaturalSpeech 2**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09116): Zero-shot speech and singing synthesis using continuous codec and latent diffusion model.
  + [**TTS Survey**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15561), [**TTS Tutorials**](https://github.com/tts-tutorial), and [**NeuralSpeech**](https://github.com/microsoft/NeuralSpeech) github repo.
  + A book on [**Neural TTS**](https://link.springer.com/book/9789819908264).
* ***Music Generation***
  + [**Muzic**](https://github.com/microsoft/muzic): A research project on AI music understanding and generation.
  + [**DeepRapper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01875), [**TeleMelody**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09617): Song writing, such as lyric generation, lyric-to-melody generation.
  + [**MeloForm**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14345), [**Museformer**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10349): Melody generation with structure modeling.
  + [**HiFiSinger**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01776): High-fidelity singing voice synthesis. 
* ***Digital Human Generation***
  + [**GAIA**](https://github.com/microsoft/GAIA): a research project on Generative AI for Avatar. 
  + [**HiFace**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11225): 3D face reconstruction; [**StableFace**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13717): talking-face video generation without jittering; [**MemFace**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05005): alleviate one-to-many mapping using memories; [**DAE-Talker**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17550): high-fidelity talking face generation using diffusion autoencoder. 
* ***Text Generation***
  + [**MASS**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02450): The first pre-trained language model for sequence-to-sequence generation.
  + [**Human-Parity on Machine Translation**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05567): Human-level quality on Chinese-English news translation.
